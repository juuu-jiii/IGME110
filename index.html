<h1>MY PERSONAL WEBSITE</h1>

<p>
    Hello world
    This is the first paragraph of text in this website.<br>
    Look! I know how to use HTML and CSS! <b>Double trouble</b>!<br>
    Wait! Is that <i>bold</i> text I see? Triple Threat!<br>
    Hold up! Is that <u>italicised</u> text I see? Fantastic Four!<br>
    Woah! Is that UNDERLINED text? Fabulous Five!<br>
    There's no point cheering for capitalised text, though.<br>
    I am very excited to have the opportunity to work on such a project.
    Such a privilege. Also, please appreciate my attempt to make the
    paragraphs appear longer by the use of line breaks, margins and padding.
</p>

<p>
    In this assignment, we need a second paragraph of text.
    So, here it is.<br>
    In this assignment, also we need to link another external website.
    So, <a href="http://eelslap.com/">here it is</a>.<br>
    In this assignment, we also need to add a photograph.
    So, here it is:
    <img src="media/Useless.jpg" ; alt="Useless" ; height=500; width=600>
    I sincerely hope you enjoyed my self-protrait.<br>
    Thank you for your time.<br>
    Goodnight.
